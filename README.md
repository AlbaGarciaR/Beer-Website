# Beer-Website
Project started at l'Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. Data base management with MySQL and Php. 

This project was started with Florian Mercier within the limits of the Informatics course of the ECL.
We had to create a website that was able to manage a database created with MySQL and PhpMyAdmin.
The website had to be created with plain HTML code and the graphic part was made with css.

Note : The adress of pictures must be changed so they can be displayed. We're working on it.
